// KeepAlive asks the system to keep the app running work it started -
// an agent run, a long download - until release is called:
//
//   - Desktops: the computer doesn't go to sleep while idle.
//   - iOS: the app gets the short grace period iOS allows after it
//     leaves the screen (about 30 seconds), via beginBackgroundTask.
//   - Android: a foreground service keeps the app running after it
//     leaves the screen, with an ongoing notification showing reason.
//     Call it while the app is shown. The app's manifest must declare
//     the service (see docs/platform.md), which gogio can't do yet;
//     without it KeepAlive returns an error wrapping ErrNotSupported,
//     so the app can tell the user to keep it open (with
//     KeepScreenOn) or save its progress in OnBackground.
//
// reason is shown where the platform shows one (Android's
// notification, Linux's inhibitor list, macOS's power assertions).
