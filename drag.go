// layoutDrag registers a whole-window system-move area so pressing
// empty (non-widget) space drags a frameless window, the way an OS
// titlebar would. It must be laid out before the rest of the view:
// Gio resolves overlapping system.ActionInputOp registrations to
// whichever was registered most recently (see gioui.org/io/input's
// TestPointerSystemAction/"uses topmost action op"), so interactive
// widgets - which each carve out their own bounds with
// kit.BlockDrag/BlockDragHere while they lay themselves out, later in
// the frame - win over this at their own position.
//
// This can't be driven reactively from an observed press the way
// dragging used to be attempted (tracking pointer.Grabbed priority):
// the OS resolves whether a press starts a window-move before
// delivering it as a normal click (on Windows, in the WM_NCHITTEST
// handler, which runs ahead of WM_LBUTTONDOWN), so the registration
// has to be present proactively, every frame, regardless of pointer
// state.

// It's registered after the rest of the view, not before: PassOp
// keeps it from blocking ordinary (non-pass-through) widgets, but
// does not make it immune to being blocked BY them, and almost every
// pixel of a real UI is covered by some such widget - see
// menu.Context's doc comment for the full reasoning, which applies
// here identically.
