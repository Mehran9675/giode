# Platform services

Services apps reach outside their window: links, the safe area, the system theme, device
details, haptics, notifications, staying awake, secure storage, pickers and dictation.
File dialogs, sharing, the Back button and background/foreground callbacks are in
[window.md](window.md).

"–" means the call returns `ErrNotSupported` (or, for `Haptic`, does nothing). The iOS
code is compiled in CI but hasn't run on a device.

## Links

```go
err := app.OpenURL(ctx, "https://gioui.org")
```

Opens the link in the app that handles it. Only `http`, `https`, `mailto`, `tel` and `sms`
links are opened, so a link in untrusted content (a model's reply) can't reach local files
or scripts. `RichText` and `Markdown` links open through it unless they have their own
`OnLink`. An in-app browser (Custom Tabs, `SFSafariViewController`) isn't available:
Custom Tabs needs an AndroidX library gogio doesn't bundle.

## Safe area and keyboard

`giode.SafeArea()` returns the insets covered by system UI (status bar, navigation bar,
notch, and on iOS the keyboard) in dp. By default the view is laid out inside them; with
`Config.EdgeToEdge` it covers the whole window and you pad with `SafeArea()`. On Android
the window shrinks for the keyboard, so content at the bottom stays above it either way.
`app.HideKeyboard()` hides the keyboard and clears focus.

## System theme and device

`Config.FollowSystemTheme` sets the theme mode from the platform's light/dark appearance
at startup and when it changes (checked every few seconds and whenever the window regains
focus); `Config.OnSystemThemeChange` is called on changes. `giode.SystemDarkMode()` reads
it once.

`giode.Device()` returns `TotalRAM`, `Class` (phone, tablet - a window whose shorter side is
at least 600dp - or desktop), `OS`, `OSVersion` and `Model`.

## Haptics and notifications

```go
giode.Haptic(giode.HapticSuccess) // HapticLight, HapticMedium, HapticHeavy, HapticSuccess, HapticWarning
err := app.Notify("Research finished", "3 sources, 2 minutes")
```

`OnLongPress` plays `HapticHeavy`. On Android, haptics follow the user's touch feedback
setting. `Notify` uses `gioui.org/x/notify`; on Android 13+ the system asks for permission
the first time, and an app built with `-targetsdk 33` or higher can't notify at all,
because gogio can't declare `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`. iOS notifications aren't implemented.

## Staying awake

`app.KeepScreenOn(true)` keeps the screen on while the app is shown, for on-device
generation the user is watching.

`release, err := app.KeepAlive("Researching")` keeps work running: desktops don't go to
idle sleep, and iOS grants its short background grace period (about 30 seconds).

On Android it starts a foreground service, which keeps the app running after it leaves
the screen and shows an ongoing notification with the reason; tapping it brings the app
back. Call it while the app is shown (Android doesn't let a backgrounded app start one),
and call `release` when the work is done. The service is in giode's helper, but Android
only runs a service the app's manifest declares:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC"/>
<application ...>
	<service android:name="org.giode.mobile.KeepAliveService"
		android:foregroundServiceType="dataSync" android:exported="false"/>
</application>
```

The [giode CLI](https://github.com/mehran9675/giode-cli) adds them when `giode.toml` has
`keep_alive = true` under `[android]`; gogio alone can't. Without the declaration
`KeepAlive` returns an error wrapping `ErrNotSupported`; keep the app open with
`KeepScreenOn` and save progress in `OnBackground` as a fallback. Android 15
limits `dataSync` services to six hours a day, after which the service stops.

## Secure storage

```go
giode.SecureStore.Service = "com.example.pocketagent" // set once, before use
err := giode.SecureStore.Set("anthropic.key", []byte(key))
key, err := giode.SecureStore.Get("anthropic.key") // ErrNotFound if unset
err = giode.SecureStore.Delete("anthropic.key")
```

Values live in the platform's credential store: the Android Keystore (AES-GCM with a key
that never leaves the device), the Keychain (on iOS accessible after first unlock, this
device only), DPAPI-encrypted files on Windows, and the Secret Service (GNOME Keyring,
KWallet) on Linux. Calls can block - a Linux keyring may prompt to unlock - so keep them
off the UI goroutine.

## Picking files and photos

```go
files, err := app.PickFiles(ctx, giode.PickOptions{Types: []string{"image/*", "application/pdf"}, Multiple: true})
for _, f := range files {
	fmt.Println(f.Name, f.MIME, f.Size) // "Q3 report.pdf", "application/pdf", 182345
}

photo, err := app.PickPhoto(ctx, giode.PhotoOptions{Source: giode.PhotoLibrary, MaxSide: 2048})
```

`PickedFile` is an `io.ReadCloser` with `Name`, `MIME` (from the extension, or sniffed from
the content) and `Size` (-1 when unknown). On desktops `Path` is the file's absolute path,
for work that needs the file rather than a stream (a disk image read at random offsets);
it's empty on Android, iOS and the web. `PickPhoto` returns an upright JPEG scaled to
`MaxSide`: Android's photo picker (Android 13+, the image picker before) or camera, and
PHPicker on iOS 14+, decode HEIC on the device, so HEIC never reaches the app. On desktops
it picks an image file (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP). The iOS camera needs
`NSCameraUsageDescription` in Info.plist (see [Info.plist keys on iOS](#infoplist-keys-on-ios));
without it `PickPhoto` returns an error wrapping `ErrNotSupported` rather than letting iOS
end the app. Like `OpenFile`, these block: call them from a goroutine.

Reading an image from the clipboard isn't supported yet.

`PickFolder` asks for a folder and returns its path: a destination for exported or
recovered files.

```go
dir, err := app.PickFolder(ctx, giode.FolderOptions{Title: "Where should recovered files go?"})
if errors.Is(err, giode.ErrCanceled) {
	return
}
```

It uses IFileOpenDialog on Windows, NSOpenPanel on macOS and the XDG desktop portal on
Linux, falling back to zenity, qarma or kdialog when no portal runs. Android, iOS and the
web return `ErrNotSupported`: apps there get no plain paths to the user's folders.

## Administrator rights

`giode.IsElevated()` reports whether the app runs elevated (UAC on Windows, root on Linux
and macOS). `app.RestartElevated(args...)` asks the user for administrator rights, starts a
new copy of the app with them (with `args`, or this launch's arguments when nil) and quits
this one; it returns `ErrDeclined` when the user refuses, leaving this copy running.

```go
if !giode.IsElevated() {
	err := app.RestartElevated() // UAC, pkexec or the macOS password prompt
}
```

With a `SingleInstanceLock`, the new copy waits for this one to exit and takes the lock
over. Running the whole UI elevated is what some disk tools need; when the work allows, a
small elevated helper process is the safer design.

## Dictation

```go
results, err := app.Dictate(ctx, "en-US")
for r := range results {
	composer.SetText(r.Text) // the whole transcript so far
	if r.Final { break }
}
```

On Android it uses `SpeechRecognizer`, asking for the microphone permission the first
time; import `gioui.org/app/permission/microphone`. On iOS it uses `SFSpeechRecognizer`
with the microphone, asking for both permissions the first time, and ends after a two
second pause, as Android does. It needs `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` and
`NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` in Info.plist; without them `Dictate` returns an
error wrapping `ErrNotSupported`.

## Info.plist keys on iOS

iOS ends an app that uses the camera, microphone or speech recognition without a line in
its Info.plist explaining why, shown in the permission prompt. With the
[giode CLI](https://github.com/mehran9675/giode-cli), list them in `giode.toml`:

```toml
[ios.usage]
camera = "To attach photos you take."
microphone = "To dictate messages."
speech = "To dictate messages."
```

gogio writes Info.plist itself and has no option to add keys, so with gogio add them to
the built app before installing it:

```sh
gogio -target ios -arch amd64 -appid com.example.app -o App.app .
plutil -insert NSCameraUsageDescription -string "To attach photos you take." App.app/Info.plist
plutil -insert NSMicrophoneUsageDescription -string "To dictate messages." App.app/Info.plist
plutil -insert NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription -string "To dictate messages." App.app/Info.plist
codesign -f -s - App.app   # re-sign after editing; use your identity for a device build
```

For a device `.ipa`, unzip it, edit `Payload/App.app/Info.plist` the same way, and
re-sign the app with your identity and its entitlements before zipping it again.

## Links that open the app

`Config.OnOpenURL` receives the links that open the app, or reach it while it runs, on the
UI goroutine:

```go
giode.Config{
	OnOpenURL: func(u *url.URL) {
		// myapp://chat/42 or https://example.com/app/chat/42
		router.Go(u.Path)
	},
}
```

- **URL schemes** (`myapp://...`): list them in `giode.toml` as `app.schemes`. They work on
  Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and Linux (from the `.desktop` file the CLI writes).
- **Universal links and Android App Links** (`https://example.com/app/...`): list them as
  `app.links`; `giode links` writes the two files your site must serve (see the CLI's
  README). iOS and macOS need the Associated Domains capability in the provisioning profile.

With a `SingleInstanceLock`, a link that starts a second desktop instance is handed to the
running one.

## Updating desktop apps

The `update` package updates a desktop app from a feed you host: it checks for a newer
version, downloads it, verifies it, replaces the app and restarts it.

```go
import "github.com/mehran9675/giode/update"

u := update.New() // feed URL, public key and version from giode.toml, via the giode CLI
if rel, err := u.Check(ctx); err == nil && rel != nil {
	// Offer rel.Version and rel.Notes; then:
	dl, err := u.Download(ctx, rel, func(done, total int64) { progress.Set(done, total) })
	if err == nil {
		err = dl.Install() // replaces the app and restarts it; doesn't return on success
	}
}
```

Set it up with the CLI: `giode update-key` makes an Ed25519 key pair (keep the private key
out of the repository; it signs releases), and `giode release -base-url https://...` writes
`dist/update/` - the signed `feed.json`, `feed.json.sig` and a download per platform - to
upload to that URL. The app accepts only a feed signed with its key and downloads whose
SHA-256 the feed lists.

| Platform | What the feed offers | Installing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | the program (`exe`) or the setup program (`installer`) | renames the running program aside and puts the new one in place; or runs the setup program silently once the app exits |
| macOS | the zipped universal app (`app.zip`) | swaps the `.app` bundle |
| Linux | the program (`binary`) or AppImage (`appimage`) | replaces the file |

The app restarts with the same arguments; the old version is deleted on the next start.
Apps installed by a package manager or store (`.deb`, `.rpm`, Flatpak, Snap, MSIX, the Mac
App Store) are updated by it: `Check` returns `update.ErrManaged`.

## Crash reports

The `crash` package records the app's crashes and hands them back on the next start, on
every platform:

```go
import "github.com/mehran9675/giode/crash"

func main() {
	crash.Init(crash.Options{Version: "1.4.0"})
	if reports := crash.Reports(); len(reports) > 0 {
		// Offer to send them; then:
		for _, r := range reports {
			if r.Send(ctx, "https://example.com/api/crashes") == nil {
				r.Delete()
			}
		}
	}
	...
}
```

A crash is an unrecovered panic or a fatal error on any goroutine, including background
ones: the Go runtime writes the message and every goroutine's stack to the crash file as
the app dies (`runtime/debug.SetCrashOutput`). A `Report` has the message, the full trace,
the app and Go versions and the platform; `Send` posts it as JSON, and the newest ten are
kept. Crashes in Java (Android) or Objective-C (Apple) threads aren't Go's and aren't
recorded.

## Push notifications

The `push` package receives remote notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging on Android,
APNs on iOS and macOS.

```go
import "github.com/mehran9675/giode/push"

func main() {
	app := giode.New(giode.Config{Title: "Chat"})
	push.Listen(app, push.Handlers{
		Token:   func(t string) { sendTokenToServer(t) },  // a new or rotated token
		Message: func(m push.Message) { app.Post(func() { showBanner(m) }) },
		Open:    func(m push.Message) { app.Post(func() { openChat(m.Data["chat"]) }) },
	})
	go func() {
		push.RequestPermission(ctx, app) // iOS, macOS, Android 13+
		if t, err := push.Token(ctx); err == nil {
			sendTokenToServer(t)
		}
	}()
	app.Run(view)
}
```

Messages arriving in the background are shown by the system; tapping one opens the app
and calls `Open`, also when it launched the app (events from before `Listen` are kept
for it). Messages arriving while the app runs, and data-only messages, go to `Message`,
and nothing is shown unless the app shows it. Handlers run on their own goroutine.

Setup in `giode.toml`:

- Android: `android.google_services = "google-services.json"`, the file from the Firebase
  console for the app's id. The CLI adds Firebase Messaging and the package's service.
- iOS: `ios.push = "production"` (or `"development"`), with push enabled for the app id
  and in its provisioning profile. Silent pushes (`content-available`) wake the app.
- macOS: `macos.push`, which needs `macos.profile`, a provisioning profile.

On Android, a tap on a notification while the app is still running in the background
brings it forward without calling `Open`; only launches carry the message.

## In-app purchases

The `store` package sells products and subscriptions through Google Play Billing and the
App Store:

```go
import "github.com/mehran9675/giode/store"

store.OnUpdate(func(p store.Purchase) { grant(p) }) // early: purchases finishing later
products, err := store.Products(ctx, "pro", "coins_100")
p, err := store.Buy(ctx, app, products[0])
switch {
case errors.Is(err, store.ErrCanceled):
case err == nil && !p.Pending:
	// Verify p.Receipt (and p.Signature, on Google Play) on the server, grant, then:
	store.Finish(ctx, p, false) // true consumes it, so it can be bought again
}
```

`Product` has the localized `Price`, `PriceMicros` and `Currency`, and for subscriptions
the billing `Period` (ISO 8601, `P1M`). `Owned` lists what the user holds, for restoring
purchases on a new device; on the App Store it may ask the user to sign in, so call it
from a "Restore purchases" button. Google Play refunds purchases not finished within three
days; the App Store redelivers them through `OnUpdate` on every launch. Pending purchases
(paid in cash later, or waiting for a parent's approval) arrive through `OnUpdate` once
paid. The Apple side uses StoreKit's original API, which Objective-C can call.

## Rating prompt

`review.Request(ctx, app)` shows the store's rating prompt: Play's in-app review on
Android, the App Store's on iOS and macOS. The stores decide whether it appears (the App
Store at most three times a year) and don't say what the user did, so ask after the user
finished something worthwhile, not from a button.

## Languages and right-to-left layout

Translations are opt-in. Set `Config.Intl` and giode loads the message files from a folder
at startup; `giode.Intl(key, data)` reads them:

```
locales/
  en.json   {"greeting": "Hello, {name}!",
             "unread": {"one": "{count} message", "other": "{count} messages"}}
  fa.json   {"greeting": "سلام {name}!", ...}
```

```go
app := giode.New(giode.Config{
	Intl: &giode.IntlOptions{Dir: "locales"}, // the default folder
})

giode.Text(giode.Intl("greeting", map[string]any{"name": user.Name})) // "Hello, Ana!"
giode.Text(giode.Intl("greeting", user))                              // a struct: its fields
giode.Text(giode.Intl("greeting", "name", user.Name))                 // name, value pairs
giode.Text(giode.Intl("unread", map[string]any{"count": n}))          // plural form by count

giode.SetLocale("fa") // the UI redraws in Persian, right to left
```

The data fills the message's `{placeholders}`: a map, a struct (fields by name, by `json`
tag, or with a lower-case first letter) or name, value pairs. When the message has plural
forms, a `count` (or `n`) value picks one. A missing key returns the key itself.

A relative `Dir` is looked for in the working directory, next to the executable, then in a
macOS app bundle's `Resources`. To ship the translations inside the executable, which
Android, iOS and the web need since apps there have no folder beside them, embed the folder
and pass it as `FS`:

```go
//go:embed locales
var locales embed.FS

giode.Config{Intl: &giode.IntlOptions{FS: locales, Dir: "locales", Fallback: "en"}}
```

The `i18n` package underneath has the same functions for code that doesn't import giode
(`i18n.Intl`, `i18n.Load`, `i18n.LoadDir`, `i18n.T`, `i18n.N`).

A message file maps keys to text or to plural forms (`zero`, `one`, `two`, `few`, `many`,
`other`), chosen by the language's plural rules (English, French, Russian, Polish, Arabic,
Hebrew and others are built in). Lookups fall back from `fa-IR` to `fa` to the fallback
locale (English) to the key itself.

The locale is the system's unless `Config.Locale` says otherwise; `giode.SetLocale` switches
it at runtime and the UI redraws. In a right-to-left locale (Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, Urdu,
...) giode mirrors the layout as CSS does for `direction: rtl`: rows run from the right,
columns align to the right, and text aligns from the right. Absolutely positioned boxes
keep their physical `Left` and `Right`. Load a font with the script's glyphs (see
[styles.md](styles.md)): the bundled fonts cover Latin, Greek and Cyrillic.

## Open-source notices

Apps must show the licenses of the code they include. `giode licenses` (in the CLI) writes
the licenses of every Go module the app is built from, on any platform, plus Go's own, to
`assets/licenses.json`; set `app.licenses` in `giode.toml` and every build refreshes it.
Show it with `LicensesView`, a list of modules that expand to their license text:

```go
//go:embed assets/licenses.json
var licensesJSON []byte

var licenses = giode.LicensesView(licensesJSON)

// In an "Open-source licenses" screen:
licenses
```
