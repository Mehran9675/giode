# Window configuration

`giode.New(giode.Config{...})` creates the app. The options cover the common window
settings of desktop applications; unsupported platform features are ignored.

## Config fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Title` | `string` | `""` | Window title. |
| `Size` | `image.Point` | 800x600 | Initial window size in dp. |
| `MinSize` / `MaxSize` | `image.Point` | — | Size bounds when resizable. |
| `MinWidth` / `MinHeight` / `MaxWidth` / `MaxHeight` | `int` | — | Per-axis size bounds; combine with `MinSize`/`MaxSize` (tighter bound wins). |
| `Resizable` | `bool` | `false` | Allow user resizing. When false the size is locked to `Size`. |
| `Frameless` | `bool` | `false` | Remove the OS title bar and borders. |
| `Draggable` | `bool` | `false` | Drag the window from empty (non-widget) space anywhere. Frameless only. For a custom title bar, use [TitleBar](components/titlebar.md) instead. |
| `OnFileDrop` | `func(paths []string)` | `nil` | Files dropped onto the window from the file manager, on the UI goroutine. Windows only for now. |
| `OnWindowStateChange` | `func(WindowState)` | `nil` | Runs when the window is minimized, maximized, made fullscreen or restored. |
| `Background` | `string` | `"#000000"` | Window background color (any CSS hex, or a theme token such as `"theme.background"`, which follows `SetMode`/`SetPalette`). |
| `StatusBar` / `NavigationBar` | `string` | `Background` | Colors of Android's status and navigation bars. They follow theme changes, so the bars match a light or dark app. Ignored elsewhere. |
| `Orientation` | `Orientation` | `OrientationAny` | Rotation on mobile: `OrientationAny`, `OrientationPortrait`, `OrientationLandscape`. Ignored on desktop. |
| `Icon` | `[]byte` | `nil` | Window icon, PNG or JPEG bytes. Applied at runtime on Windows. |
| `WindowStartState` | `WindowStartState` | `WindowStartNormal` | Initial state: `WindowStartMinimized`, `WindowStartMaximized`, `WindowStartFullscreen`. Takes precedence over the flags below. |
| `Fullscreen` / `Maximized` / `Minimized` | `bool` | `false` | Start in the given state (used when `WindowStartState` is `WindowStartNormal`). |
| `Center` | `bool` | `false` | Start centered on the screen. |
| `AlwaysOnTop` | `bool` | `false` | Keep above other windows. |
| `Logger` | `Logger` | `nil` | Receives diagnostics; any `*log.Logger` satisfies it. |
| `LogLevel` | `LogLevel` | `LogLevelDebug` | `LogLevelDebug`, `LogLevelInfo`, `LogLevelWarning`, `LogLevelError`. |
| `ShowFrameTimes` | `bool` | `false` | Draw a counter with frame build and render times and the frame rate, for finding stutter on a device; see [performance.md](performance.md#measuring-frame-times). |
| `OnStartup` | `func()` | `nil` | Runs before the event loop starts. |
| `OnReady` | `func()` | `nil` | Runs after the first frame is presented. |
| `OnShutdown` | `func()` | `nil` | Runs after the window closes. Mobile systems may end a backgrounded app without it running: save in `OnBackground`. |
| `OnBackground` / `OnForeground` | `func()` | `nil` | The app left the screen / came back; see [Background and foreground](#background-and-foreground). |
| `OnEvent` | `func(event.Event)` | `nil` | Observes every window event before giode handles it, for Gio extensions that need them. Must not call `FrameEvent.Frame`. |
| `OnBeforeClose` | `func()` | `nil` | Runs when a close is requested. It cannot veto the close. |
| `SingleInstanceLock` | `*SingleInstanceLock` | `nil` | Ensures only one instance runs; see below. |

## Single instance

```go
app := giode.New(giode.Config{
	SingleInstanceLock: &giode.SingleInstanceLock{
		UniqueID: "c9c8fd93-6758-4144-87d1-34bdb0a8bd60",
		OnSecondInstanceLaunch: func() {
			fmt.Println("already running")
		},
	},
})
```

When a second instance launches, its `OnSecondInstanceLaunch` callback runs and the
instance exits without showing a window. The lock survives crashes (a dead owner's lock
is reclaimed).

## Runtime window actions

```go
app.SetFullscreen(true) // or false to leave fullscreen
app.Minimize()
app.Maximize()
app.Unmaximize()
app.Center()
app.Raise()
app.Close()
app.SetSize(400, 840) // in dp; widens Min/Max bounds when needed
```

`app.Window()` returns the underlying `*app.Window` for anything not covered here.

## Draggable windows

`Draggable: true` registers the window background as a native move area only while the
pointer hovers empty space, so widgets keep receiving clicks. The drag is OS-native: the
window moves with the mouse like a title-bar drag.

## Window icon

Pass PNG or JPEG bytes and the icon is applied to the window (title bar and taskbar) at
runtime on Windows:

```go
icon, _ := os.ReadFile("app.png") // or embed the bytes with go:embed
app := giode.New(giode.Config{Icon: icon})
```

The icon shown by file managers comes from the executable, not the running window, and
is embedded at build time instead:

```sh
rsrc -ico app.ico -o app.syso   # or goversioninfo / windres
go build
```

## Opening and saving files

```go
go func() {
	f, err := app.OpenFile(ctx, giode.FileFilter{Extensions: []string{"wav", "mp3"}})
	if errors.Is(err, giode.ErrCanceled) {
		return
	}
	if err != nil { ... }
	defer f.Close()
	data, err := io.ReadAll(f)
	app.Post(func() { load(data) }) // back to the UI goroutine
}()
```

`OpenFile`, `OpenFiles` and `SaveFile(ctx, "speech.wav")` show the platform's own picker:
the system picker on Android and iOS, the only way apps there can reach the user's files,
and the native dialogs on desktops (through the XDG desktop portal on Linux). They're
built on `gioui.org/x/explorer`, which giode feeds the window events it needs.

They block until the user decides, so **call them from a goroutine**, never from a click
handler: the picker needs the event loop running. `ErrCanceled` means the user closed the
picker; when `ctx` ends first they return `ctx.Err()` (the picker may stay open, and a file
chosen after that is closed). One dialog shows at a time.

For other Gio extensions that need the window's events, set `Config.OnEvent`.

## Sharing

```go
err := app.Share(ctx, giode.ShareFile{Path: p, MIME: "audio/wav"})
err := app.Share(ctx, giode.ShareText{Text: link, Subject: "Listen to this"})
```

On Android, `Share` opens the system share sheet. A shared file is first copied into the
device's Downloads folder: apps built with gogio can't declare the `FileProvider` Android
otherwise requires for handing files to other apps, and MediaStore is the provider left.
This needs Android 10 or later. The helper is a small Java class shipped as a `.jar` in
`internal/mobile`, which gogio packs into the APK automatically.

On desktops, `ShareText` copies the text to the clipboard and `ShareFile` shows the file in
the file manager (Explorer, Finder, or the freedesktop file manager on Linux). On iOS it opens
the share sheet (`UIActivityViewController`, a popover on iPad) with the file itself; on
the web `Share` returns `ErrNotSupported`. A large file takes a moment to copy, so
call `Share` from a goroutine too.

## Background and foreground

`OnBackground` runs when the app leaves the screen, `OnForeground` when it comes back:

- **Android**: when the activity stops and starts again - the user switched apps, went
  home, locked the phone, or opened a system picker. Android may freeze the app soon after
  and end it later without warning, so **`OnBackground` is the last reliable moment to
  save** (a draft, unsent input). Don't rely on `OnShutdown` or `OnBeforeClose` there.
- **Desktop**: when the window is minimized and restored.
- **iOS**: when the app enters the background and returns (`UIApplication`
  notifications). iOS suspends a backgrounded app within seconds, so save here too;
  `KeepAlive` buys about 30 seconds (see [platform.md](platform.md#staying-awake)).

On Android they run synchronously on the platform's main thread, on desktops on the UI
goroutine. Keep them short, make any state they touch safe to use from another goroutine
(a `State`, or a lock), and don't wait on the UI (`RunOnUI`) from them.

## System tray and the macOS menu bar

`app.Tray()` puts an icon in the system tray: the notification area on Windows, the menu
bar on macOS, the status notifier area on Linux (KDE and most desktops; GNOME needs the
AppIndicator extension).

```go
a := giode.New(giode.Config{
	Title:          "Pocket Agent",
	Icon:           iconPNG,
	MinimizeToTray: true, // minimizing hides the window to the tray
	CloseToTray:    true, // so does closing it; Quit ends the app
})
a.Tray().
	SetTemplateIcon(trayPNG). // tinted to match the macOS menu bar
	SetTooltip("Pocket Agent").
	SetMenu(
		giode.TrayAction("Open", a.ShowWindow),
		giode.TrayCheckbox("Do not disturb", dnd, toggleDND),
		giode.TraySubmenu("Recent", recentItems...),
		giode.TraySeparator(),
		giode.TrayAction("Quit", a.Quit),
	)
```

| Method | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `SetIcon(png)` / `SetTemplateIcon(png)` | The icon; without one, `Config.Icon`. A template icon is black on transparency and macOS tints it for light and dark menu bars. |
| `SetTitle(text)` | Text next to the icon in the **macOS menu bar** (and Linux panels that show it): an unread count, a timer, a status. Update it whenever you like. |
| `SetTooltip(text)` | Hover text. |
| `SetMenu(items...)` | Replaces the menu. Call it again to change items or check marks. Item callbacks run on the UI goroutine. |
| `OnClick(fn)` | What a click on the icon does. By default it shows or hides the window on Windows and Linux; on macOS a click opens the menu. |
| `Remove()` | Takes the icon away. |

The window can hide without closing: `HideWindow()`, `ShowWindow()` and `WindowVisible()`.
A hidden window leaves the screen and the taskbar or Dock, and comes back as it was;
clicking the Dock icon brings it back on macOS. `Config.MenuBarApp` makes a macOS app a
menu bar utility, with no Dock icon or app menu. `Quit()` ends the app even with
`CloseToTray`, as does `Close()`.

Platform notes: on Linux, hiding works under X11; Wayland can't hide windows, so there the
window minimizes, and `CloseToTray` isn't available (closing quits). Android, iOS and the
web have no tray: `TraySupported()` reports false and the calls do nothing.

## File manager context menu

Context actions add entries to the file manager's right-click menu that open the app with
the chosen files or folders - "Ask Pocket Agent about this file", "Open Pocket Agent here".
Declare them in `giode.toml` (see the CLI's README) or in `Config.ContextActions`, and
handle them in `Config.OnContextAction`:

```go
a := giode.New(giode.Config{
	SingleInstanceLock: &giode.SingleInstanceLock{UniqueID: "com.example.agent"},
	ContextActions: []giode.ContextAction{
		{ID: "ask", Label: "Ask Pocket Agent", Extensions: []string{".md", ".txt"}},
		{ID: "here", Label: "Open Pocket Agent here", Folders: true, FolderBackground: true},
	},
	OnContextAction: func(id string, paths []string) {
		switch id {
		case "ask":
			chat.Attach(paths...)
		case "here":
			chat.SetWorkingDir(paths[0])
		}
		a.ShowWindow()
	},
	OnStartup: func() { a.InstallContextActions() },
})
```

| Platform | Where they appear | How they're registered |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | Explorer's context menu (on Windows 11, under "Show more options") | The setup program from `giode build windows-installer`, or `App.InstallContextActions()` for the current user (no admin rights) |
| macOS | Finder's Quick Actions / Services submenu | The `NSServices` entries `giode build macos` writes; macOS picks them up once the app is in `/Applications` and has run once |
| Linux | GNOME Files and Caja (under Scripts), Dolphin, Nemo | `App.InstallContextActions()`, into the user's home |

Choosing an action starts the app with `--giode-action=<id> <paths>`; giode parses that and
runs `OnContextAction` on the UI goroutine. With a `SingleInstanceLock`, an action chosen
while the app runs goes to the running instance instead of starting a second one.
`UninstallContextActions()` removes what `InstallContextActions` added.

The single-instance lock now also passes any second launch's arguments to the running
instance: `SingleInstanceLock.OnLaunchArgs` receives them (a file opened with the app,
say), and the window comes to the front.

## Not supported

A few common window features are deliberately absent because Gio does not expose them:
closable/minimizable/maximizable flags, window transparency, positioning by coordinates,
native application menus and power-state callbacks (suspend/resume).

## Clipboard

```go
app.SetClipboard("copied text")             // from any goroutine; applied on the next frame
app.ReadClipboard(func(text string) { ... }) // fn runs on the UI goroutine
```

Inside a `Layout`, `kit.WriteClipboard(gtx, text)` copies immediately. For a ready-made
control, `giode.CopyButton(func() string { return value })` copies when clicked and shows a
check mark for a moment (`Labels`, `Feedback`, `OnCopy` customize it).

## Back button

`Dialog`, `Drawer` and `Menu` close on Escape and on the system Back button (Android)
while open, and `Router` goes back while it has history. For anything else, register a
handler from `Layout`, every frame, for as long as Back has something to do:

```go
func (p *EditorPage) Layout(gtx layout.Context) layout.Dimensions {
	if p.dirty {
		giode.HandleBack(func() { p.confirmDiscard = true })
	}
	...
}
```

The handler registered last in the frame wins, so an overlay on top takes Back before the
page beneath it, and only one handler runs. Handlers run after the frame's layout, so they
may change anything the view reads. When nothing is registered, Back is left to the
platform: on Android it closes the app as usual. `HandleBack` reacts to Back only;
`elements.HandleDismiss` also reacts to Escape and is what overlays use.

Handlers are registered during layout rather than consulted when Back is pressed because
Android decides whether the app handled Back the moment it's pressed, from the handlers
registered in the last frame - a callback that returned false later could no longer hand
the press back to the system.

## File drop

```go
giode.Config{
	OnFileDrop: func(paths []string) {
		model.files = append(model.files, paths...) // UI goroutine: no locks needed
	},
}
```

On Windows the app subclasses its own window and accepts `WM_DROPFILES`, including when it
runs as administrator (it lets the drop messages through Windows' privilege filter, which
would otherwise silently block drops from a normal Explorer).

Other platforms don't support it yet, and a warning is logged once if `OnFileDrop` is set
there. Gio's own event loop consumes the X11 and Wayland drag-and-drop protocol messages, so
Linux support needs changes in Gio itself. macOS support needs AppKit drag registration,
which is not implemented yet. Drag enter/leave events (for highlighting a drop zone) aren't
available yet either; they need Windows' COM `IDropTarget` instead of `WM_DROPFILES`.

## Drawing video or 3D under the UI

`Config.Underlay` draws caller-rendered GPU content into each frame before the UI, without
copying it off the GPU: video frames from libmpv, a 3D or map engine. It runs on the
window's render thread with the window's GPU context current; the UI is then drawn over
its output without clearing, so only the UI's own backgrounds cover it (`Background`
isn't painted).

```go
app := giode.New(giode.Config{
	Renderer: giode.RendererOpenGL, // an OpenGL (ES) context on every platform
	Underlay: func(t giode.GPUTarget) {
		mpvRender(t.Framebuffer, t.Size.X, t.Size.Y) // flip Y: GL's origin is bottom left
	},
})
// From any goroutine, when the engine has a new frame:
app.Invalidate()
```

`GPUTarget` describes the frame's render target: `API` (`GPUOpenGL`, `GPUMetal`,
`GPUDirect3D11`, `GPUVulkan`), the OpenGL `Framebuffer` (0 is the window's), or the
`Texture` handle - the `MTLTexture` or `ID3D11RenderTargetView` - and the `Size` in
pixels. Engines with Metal or Direct3D renderers can keep Gio's defaults and draw into the
texture; commit their work before returning, since Gio draws with its own command queue.

`Renderer: giode.RendererOpenGL` asks for OpenGL everywhere:

| Platform | OpenGL |
| --- | --- |
| Linux, Android | OpenGL ES through EGL, Gio's default. |
| Windows | OpenGL ES through ANGLE: `libEGL.dll` and `libGLESv2.dll` must be next to the executable (see `[native]` in the giode CLI). |
| macOS, iOS | Gio's OpenGL renderer, built with the `nometal` tag: set `renderer = "opengl"` under `[app]` in `giode.toml`. |

Gio's OpenGL renderer saves and restores the GL state it changes around its frames, and
switches off scissor, depth and stencil tests and face culling an engine leaves on, so
engines don't need to clean up after themselves.

Both need giode's patched Gio, which `giode build` and `giode run` build against (adding
the `giode_gio` tag); a plain `go build` gets an error from `Run` saying so.

## Native window handle

`app.NativeHandle()` returns the native window handle: the `HWND` on Windows, the `NSView`
on macOS, the X11 window or `wl_surface` on Linux. `app.NativeView()` returns Gio's full
platform view event for other integrations. Both are zero until the window exists.
