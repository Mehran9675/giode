# Swipeable

A list row that slides sideways to reveal actions, like the delete and pin actions of
mobile mail and chat apps.

```go
row := giode.Keyed("chats", chat.ID, func() *swipeable.Swipeable {
	return giode.Swipeable(func() giode.Element { return chatRow(chat) },
		[]giode.SwipeAction{{Label: "Pin", Background: "theme.info", OnTap: func() { pin(chat) }}},
		[]giode.SwipeAction{{Label: "Delete", Background: "theme.danger", OnTap: func() { remove(chat) }}},
	)
})
```

Swiping right reveals the leading actions, swiping left the trailing ones; each is 80dp
wide. A swipe past half the actions' width opens the row, a shorter one springs back.
Tapping an action runs it and closes the row; tapping the open row closes it without
reaching the content. Vertical drags still scroll the list around it.

The content should paint an opaque background, since the actions sit behind it.

| Member | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Swipeable(content func() Element, leading, trailing []SwipeAction) *Swipeable` | Creates the row; either action list may be nil. |
| `Close()` | Slides the row back. |
| `Opened() bool` | Whether the row is open or opening. |

`SwipeAction` has `Label`, an optional `Icon` shown above it, `Background` (default
`theme.primary`), `Color` (default `theme.onprimary`) and `OnTap`.
