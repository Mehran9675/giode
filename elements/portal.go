// SetWindowSize) rather than gtx's own ambient constraints, to
// measure its size (the same technique Menu's own panel-width
// measurement uses) so the position can be clamped to stay inside the
// window, flipping above the anchor if it would overflow the bottom
// edge - see kit.ClampPos. build is then laid out for real, exactly
// once, when the queue is drained.
//
