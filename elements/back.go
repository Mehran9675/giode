// button (Android's Back gesture or key) during this frame. Call it
// from Layout, every frame, for as long as there is somewhere to go
// back to - Router does this while its history isn't empty.
//
// Handlers registered later in the frame win: content laid out on top
// (a dialog over a page) takes Back before what's beneath it, and only
// the topmost handler runs. When no handler is registered, giode
// leaves Back to the platform, which on Android closes the app.
//
// Android asks whether Back is handled the moment it is pressed, using
// the handlers registered in the last frame. That's why handlers are
// registered from Layout rather than consulted afterwards: whether
// Back is consumed must be known before the press arrives.
//
// fn runs after the current frame's layout (see AfterLayout), so it
// may change anything the view reads.
